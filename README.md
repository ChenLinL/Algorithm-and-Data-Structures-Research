# Sorting-Algorithms-Research
The purpose of the research
In this research, I implement 5 sorting algorithms, Bubble-sort, Insertion-sort, Spin-the-bottle sort, Shell sort, and Annealing sort to determine their real-world running times. 

Set up of the research
First, I implemented 5 sorting algorithms with C++. For the Shell sort and Annealing sort, I implemented them with gaps and temps from two professional papers which be cited over 1000 times. According to these two papers, the gaps and temps could help me significantly improving the performance of Shell sort and Annealing sort.  
After I finished the implementation, I used random shuffle to create random test cases to test the real- world time. Besides, I created almost sorted test cases to test the difference of running time between random numbers and almost sorted numbers.
The result time data will be stored in the timing.csv. For the graph part, I used anaconda and Spyder 3.3.1 to run the python code to generate the performance graph.
